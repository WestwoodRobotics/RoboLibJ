### This project is unmaintained
It has been over 5 years and I do not see a future for it.

I do not recommend using it.
It was written as a way to learn more java.
Many of the design choices made were very naive.

I also do not recommend using it because it is java, but that is my own opinion.

you can poke it with a stick tho.
