==

***Because of school, and exams, I will not be able to work on this as much as I would like. Normal development will continue after May 24th.***

Documentation

***NOTE***
This project is in development. That means that anything can change
including package structure, class names, method names, or anything
else that I feel needs changing.

The point of this project is to completely replace WPILib, with a more complete library.

Goals:
 * Verbose
 * Efficient
 * Built-in, Extensive logging functions
  * Save log files for each match - USB drive will be used.
  * Complete power monitoring
 * Versatile
